- 👋 Hi, I’m @viicttr and I´m a master's student in big data 
- ⚡ I’m looking for people who want to test a video games estimator 
- 📫 Just download the repository and go to estimator folder, open the videogames_estimator.ipynb file (jupyter notebook) and follow the instructions
- You can try the same video games success estimator in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/viicttr/videogames-estimator
